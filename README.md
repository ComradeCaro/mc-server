# MC Server

[![mcman badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/uses-mcman-purple?logo=github)](https://github.com/ParadigmMC/mcman)

This is my personal minecraft server made and configured with mcman. ~I have a multitude of mods installed so the experience isn't vanilla but vanilla clients can still join~ This is not the case as of now and this config will follow the vanilla base game a bit more closely in the future.

## Running

This is made solely for personal use but I've decided to make it available to anyone who wants to use it. As such however I don't offer any kind of help or support when running this. If you're still interested in running it regardless of that, I would recommend learning how to use mcman.
